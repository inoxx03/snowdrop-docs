The `README.adoc` for boosters should follow the following structure:

== Purpose

Explain the purpose of the mission in the context of an OpenShift deployment.

== Technical details

Detail what needs to be done in the code / resources / configuration to actually perform the task. Explain which tools are used
and how.

== Deploying and interacting with the booster

Detail the sequence of commands that need to be run in an already running minishift install.

== References

Links to additional information.

If the readme contains Asciidoc `include` directives, then these need to be absolute URLs so that they can be rendered by Jekyll (as github currently doesn't process Asciidoc includes: cf https://github.com/github/markup/issues/1095)
